The July 4th Anomaly: An In-Depth Analysis of the 80,000 
BTC Dormant Wallet Activation 

Executive Summary 

On and around July 4, 2025, the Bitcoin network witnessed an event of 
unprecedented scale and sophistication: the coordinated activation and transfer of 
approximately 80,000 BTC, valued at over $8.6 billion, from eight wallets that had 
remained dormant since 2011.1 This movement, the largest of its kind in Bitcoin's 
history, immediately ignited a firestorm of speculation and analysis across the digital 
asset ecosystem.3 The event presents a central and critical conflict of interpretation. 
On one hand, the public narrative, particularly in mainstream financial media, framed 
the transfers as a benign security upgrade—a prudent whale moving assets from 
vulnerable legacy addresses to modern, secure formats.3 On the other hand, a deeper 
analysis of the on-chain evidence and surrounding digital artifacts points toward a far 
more alarming conclusion: a hostile takeover of the wallets, executed through a 
masterful combination of cryptographic exploitation and elaborate psychological 
warfare. 

This report provides a comprehensive, multi-faceted investigation into the July 4th 
Anomaly. It collates and examines the verifiable on-chain data, synthesizes the 
competing public hypotheses, provides a detailed technical breakdown of the most 
plausible attack vector, and analyzes the profound, long-term implications for the 
Bitcoin network. The evidence presented herein—from the low-cost "canary" test on 
the Bitcoin Cash network that preceded the main event, to the meticulously crafted 
legal threats and cryptic messages embedded directly onto the blockchain, to the 
public demonstration of key-cracking capabilities in the months prior—weighs heavily 
against the theory of a simple owner-initiated transfer. 

The analysis concludes that the July 4th Anomaly was most likely a successful, 
large-scale cryptographic heist. This event marks a pivotal moment for the digital 
asset landscape, shattering long-held assumptions about the security of "lost" coins 

 
 
 
 
and exposing a new class of systemic risk. It demonstrates the practical application of 
long-theorized cryptographic attacks at scale, forcing a necessary, if unsettling, 
maturation in the understanding of digital risk, ownership, and security. The 
aftershocks of this event will challenge Bitcoin's technical roadmap, its economic 
models, its legal standing, and its narrative as a secure store of value, setting a 
powerful precedent for the future of decentralized finance. 

Section I: The Unassailable Record — On-Chain Forensics 

This section presents the immutable, verifiable facts of the event as recorded on the 
Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash blockchains. It serves as the empirical bedrock for all 
subsequent analysis, establishing a clear timeline and cataloging the digital artifacts 
left behind by the actor. Every hypothesis and conclusion that follows is grounded in 
this on-chain evidence. 

1.1 The Anatomy of the Event: A Chronological Reconstruction 

The operation was not a singular, impulsive act but a methodical, multi-stage process 
executed with precision across two different blockchains. This timeline reveals a level 
of planning and operational security far exceeding that of a typical user or even a 
standard institutional transfer. 

The Prelude - The BCH "Test" Transaction 

The first overt action occurred not on the Bitcoin network, but on Bitcoin Cash (BCH). 
On July 4, 2025, approximately 14 hours before the main BTC transfers, a small 
transaction was executed on the BCH blockchain from at least one of the target 
wallets.4 For addresses created before the 2017 Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash fork, the private 
keys are identical for both chains. This allowed the actor to perform a low-cost, 
low-visibility "canary" test to confirm that the compromised private key was functional 

 
 
 
 
 
 
and could successfully sign and broadcast a transaction. 

According to on-chain analysis, a key test transaction took place at 02:41:32 UTC, 
moving 10,000 BCH from the Bitcoin Cash equivalent of the legacy Bitcoin address 
12tLs9c9RsALt4ockxa1hB4iTCTSmxj2me.7 This step was a critical piece of operational 
security. It validated the exploit's success without immediately alerting the broader 
Bitcoin community, which monitors the BTC blockchain far more intensely than the 
BCH chain. This calculated verification of key access before the high-stakes main 
event is a hallmark of a professional, premeditated operation, not a panicked owner.4 

The Main Event - Coordinated BTC Transfers 

With the private keys confirmed to be active, the main operation on the Bitcoin 
network commenced. Beginning at approximately 03:43:33 UTC on July 4, 2025, a 
series of highly synchronized transactions began.7 Over the subsequent hours, 
approximately 80,000 BTC were systematically drained from eight distinct legacy 
Pay-to-PubKey-Hash (P2PKH) wallets.1 Each of these wallets, untouched for over 14 
years, held a remarkably uniform amount of around 10,000 BTC, strongly suggesting 
a common origin or owner.2 The transfers were executed with a precision and 
concurrency that points to a single entity wielding automated scripts to control all 
eight private keys simultaneously.2 

The Destination - A Security Upgrade Facade 

Crucially, the 80,000 BTC were not sent to known deposit addresses of 
cryptocurrency exchanges, a move that would have signaled an immediate intent to 
sell and would have likely triggered exchange-level alerts.5 Instead, the funds were 
migrated from the old, legacy P2PKH addresses (which begin with a '1') to new, 
modern Native SegWit (Bech32) addresses (which begin with 'bc1q').1 

On the surface, this action mimics a legitimate security upgrade. Migrating to SegWit 
addresses is a recommended best practice, as it provides enhanced security features, 
better error checking, and significantly lower future transaction fees.9 This choice of 
destination provided the actor with a plausible "cover story" that the event was merely 

 
 
 
 
a long-overdue wallet consolidation by the original owner.3 However, one of the 
destination addresses revealed a more provocative, taunting message: the vanity 
address 

bc1qwq5geath93h0lnfsrmnwnfuck2f9ypv4ewyl4j, which contains an expletive, was 
used to receive funds from source address 1f1miYFQWTzdLiCBxtHHnNiW7WAWPUccr.7 
This act of defiance stands in stark contrast to the quiet prudence of a genuine 
security upgrade. 

1.2 The Blockchain's Graffiti: Analysis of OP_RETURN Messages 

A central component of the operation was the strategic use of the OP_RETURN 
opcode. This feature allows a small amount of arbitrary data to be embedded into a 
transaction, creating a public and immutable message on the blockchain. The actor 
used this feature to wage a psychological campaign, crafting a public narrative 
directly targeting the wallet owner and the wider community.1 The messages were 
sent in a deliberate sequence to the dormant wallets in the days leading up to the 
fund transfers. 

Message Sequence and Content 

1.  The Claim (July 1): The first message, sent on July 1, 2025, was a bold and 

aggressive legal declaration: "LEGAL NOTICE: We have taken possession of this 
wallet and its contents".2 An example transaction hash for this message is 
4f7c80c05fd77a9c9b180f7f6400560d1ab6cf3a4ba1b6bf7429eeeefa500a05.7 
2.  The Ultimatum (July 1): Just 24 minutes later, a follow-up message laid out a 

challenge to the true owner: "Not abandoned? Prove it by an on-chain 
transaction using private key by Sept 30".2 An example transaction hash for this is 
e511f90160b2f189eaf0adce7221979cbc9001bc29e6c5476914d002a9d19886.7 
This message dared the owner to use their key, the only form of proof that 
matters on the blockchain. 

3.  The Legal Facade (July 3): The third message directed observers to an external 

website, professionalizing the operation: "NOTICE TO OWNER: see 
salomonbros.com/owner-notice".2 An example transaction hash for this is 

 
 
 
 
ba9958bca2ae46e5fdea8737fef02bca6cfe1723196917699a058c30b6f52fd8.7 
4.  The Cryptic Signature (July 4): The final message, sent to at least three of the 
wallets, was a cultural reference designed to mystify and engage the crypto 
community: "4 8 15 16 23 42".2 These are the infamous, enigmatic "Lost Numbers" 
from the television series 
Lost, associated with themes of fate, control, and hidden knowledge. An example 
transaction hash is 
ac35cc92a1d97298c7b2a89e1f8260da61d0447c28927585baecd2bfa863aec0.2 

This sequence was not random. It was a carefully orchestrated performance, blending 
legalistic intimidation with cryptic pop culture to create a multi-layered narrative. The 
combination of personas—a lawyer, a mystic, a punk—is indicative of a sophisticated 
psychological operation designed to confuse observers and control the story. 

The Counterparty Dust Transaction 

The initial user query specified an interest in a "Counterparty dust" transaction of 548 
satoshis. Counterparty is a protocol that allows for the creation of assets and 
execution of smart contracts on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, often by embedding 
data in standard transactions. Dust refers to a tiny, often unspendable amount of 
cryptocurrency.16 While the provided source materials extensively discuss the concept 
of dust and the use of 

OP_RETURN messages, they do not contain a specific, verifiable reference to a 548 
satoshi Counterparty transaction connected to this event. The significance of such a 
transaction, were it confirmed, would be to add yet another layer of technical 
sophistication, demonstrating the actor's ability to communicate or embed data using 
multiple protocol layers on the same blockchain. Its absence from the primary public 
analyses suggests it may be a detail from niche forensic circles or a potential 
misinterpretation. 

1.3 The "Salomon Brothers" Facade: Archival and Domain Analysis 

The salomonbros.com website was the off-chain anchor for the actor's legalistic 

 
 
 
 
narrative, lending a veneer of corporate legitimacy to the operation.2 

Domain History and Content 

The domain salomonbros.com was registered on January 6, 2023, indicating 
long-term planning. It was updated on July 1, 2025, immediately before the 
OP_RETURN campaign began.7 The specific page referenced in the blockchain 
message, 

/owner-notice, was deployed on July 3, 2025, and was archived by the Internet 
Archive's Wayback Machine on July 3rd and 4th, capturing its initial state.7 

The website itself was slick and professional, branded with the name of the defunct 
but legendary Wall Street firm Salomon Brothers, a choice laden with historical irony.15 
The 

/owner-notice page hosted a formal legal notice. It claimed "constructive possession" 
of the dormant wallets and issued a 90-day ultimatum (with a deadline cited as 
September 30 or October 5, 2025, depending on the report) for the "bona fide owner" 
to prove their ownership.1 The site offered two methods for proof: signing an on-chain 
message with the private key or submitting personal information via a web form—the 
latter being a classic phishing technique to de-anonymize the owner.15 This entire 
framework was an attempt to apply the real-world legal doctrine of "adverse 
possession," typically used for real estate, to the novel context of digital assets.1 

Real-World Connections and Misdirection 

Adding another layer of intrigue, on-chain researcher @Cyphertux noted that the 
address listed on the salomonbros.com website corresponded to the physical 
headquarters of EisnerAmper, a major accounting and advisory firm known for its 
blockchain investigation and forensic services.13 EisnerAmper has collaborated with 
the investigator credited with unmasking Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road 
darknet market.13 This connection serves a dual purpose: it either suggests an 
incredibly audacious operation with links to legitimate forensic or legal entities, or it is 
a masterfully crafted red herring designed to point suspicion toward state-level actors 

 
 
 
 
and away from the true perpetrators.

Section II: The Public Square — A Corpus of Competing 
Narratives 

The July 4th Anomaly triggered a massive, global effort to interpret the on-chain 
facts. This section deconstructs the public response, categorizing the dominant 
hypotheses that emerged on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and the Bitcointalk forum. 
It analyzes the evidence cited for each theory and provides a sentiment analysis 
reflecting its prevalence and credibility within different communities. A key finding is 
the stark gap between how mainstream finance and crypto-native communities 
interpreted the same set of facts, revealing a fundamental difference in risk 
perception and analytical frameworks. 

2.1 Hypothesis A: The "Panicked Owner" 

●  Core Argument: This hypothesis posits that the events were initiated by the 

legitimate, original owner of the 80,000 BTC. A long-term holder, this individual 
was likely spooked by the aggressive OP_RETURN spam and the 
professional-looking legal threats on the salomonbros.com website. In response, 
they decided to move their vast fortune from the old, potentially vulnerable 
P2PKH wallets to more secure, modern SegWit addresses to preemptively protect 

 
 
 
 
their assets.3 The entire operation is thus framed as a prudent, if large, security 
upgrade.5 

●  Supporting Evidence: Proponents of this theory point to several key facts. First, 
the destination addresses were new SegWit wallets, which is an established best 
practice for enhancing security and lowering transaction fees.5 Second, none of 
the funds were sent to cryptocurrency exchanges, which eases fears of an 
immediate sale and suggests the motive was consolidation, not liquidation.5 
Finally, the timing of the transfers, occurring shortly after the 
OP_RETURN messages were broadcast, strongly suggests a direct reaction to the 
perceived threat.3 

●  Sentiment: This explanation was widely reported and favored by mainstream 
financial news outlets and generalist publications.3 It is the simplest, least 
alarming, and most easily digestible narrative, as it does not imply a breach of 
Bitcoin's security. However, among deep crypto analysts and on-chain forensics 
communities, it is considered a less likely, though still plausible, theory.4 The sheer 
theatricality of the event seems inconsistent with the quiet prudence of a 
security-conscious owner. 

2.2 Hypothesis B: The "Legal Exploit / Sophisticated Heist" 

●  Core Argument: This is the antithesis of the "Panicked Owner" theory. It argues 

that the transfer was not a defensive move by the owner, but a hostile takeover by 
a sophisticated attacker who had successfully compromised the private keys 
through a cryptographic exploit.2 The elaborate legal facade, the 
OP_RETURN messages, and the salomonbros.com website were not the cause of 
the transfer but rather a brilliant and integral part of the attack itself—a 
smokescreen designed to legitimize the theft, create legal ambiguity, and 
psychologically manipulate both the victim and the public.1 

●  Supporting Evidence: This theory is supported by the technical and operational 
details of the event. The extreme precision and coordination of the simultaneous 
moves from eight independent wallets suggest automation and singular control, 
not a human owner manually managing keys.2 The use of a Bitcoin Cash test 
transaction is a key piece of evidence, as it demonstrates a cold, calculated 
verification of the exploit before the main attack—a step a legitimate owner would 
have no need to take.4 Furthermore, the cryptic and taunting nature of the "Lost 
Numbers" message and the vanity address are seen as the signature of a defiant 
hacker, not a discreet billionaire.2 Conor Grogan, Head of Product at Coinbase, 

 
 
publicly floated this possibility, calling it potentially the "biggest theft in history" if 
the wallets were indeed compromised.4 

●  Sentiment: This is the dominant theory among on-chain analysts, cryptographic 

researchers, and the crypto-native community.4 It is viewed as the most 
compelling explanation because it accounts for the full spectrum of 
evidence—the technical sophistication, the psychological manipulation, and the 
legal theater. 

2.3 Hypothesis C: The "White Hat / Ethical Warning" 

●  Core Argument: This hypothesis offers a more optimistic interpretation of the 

hostile takeover theory. It posits that the actor is a "white hat" or "ethical hacker" 
who independently discovered a critical vulnerability in how early Bitcoin wallets 
generated their keys. The 80,000 BTC transfer was a massive, public 
proof-of-concept designed to be so spectacular that it would force the Bitcoin 
community, developers, and holders of other legacy wallets to acknowledge and 
address the vulnerability before it could be exploited maliciously by criminals on a 
wider scale—perhaps even against the wallets of Satoshi Nakamoto himself.1 
Under this theory, the actor has no intention of keeping the funds and may 
eventually attempt to return them or work with law enforcement to secure them 
on behalf of the original owner. 

●  Supporting Evidence: The primary evidence for this theory is the actor's 

post-exploit behavior. They could have immediately laundered and sold the 
80,000 BTC but instead chose to move them to new, unspent addresses.5 The 
highly public nature of the act, using 
OP_RETURN messages to announce their presence, can be interpreted as a form 
of responsible (albeit dramatic) disclosure rather than a stealthy theft.1 There are 
historical precedents in the crypto space, particularly on the Ethereum platform, 
where white hat groups have moved funds from vulnerable smart contracts to 
safeguard them from impending attacks.27 

●  Sentiment: This is a hopeful but less-cited theory. It is popular among those in 
the community who wish to see a positive, ecosystem-strengthening outcome 
from the event. However, it is often viewed as less likely due to the aggressive and 
intimidating legal language used in the OP_RETURN messages and on the 
website, which seems more aligned with a hostile act than an ethical warning.28 

 
 
2.4 Hypothesis D: The "Craig Wright / Red Herring" 

●  Core Argument: This theory suggests that the event was deliberately seeded 

with tangential "clues" and stylistic elements that mimic the behavior of 
controversial figures like Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who 
claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto. The purpose of these clues was not to genuinely 
point to Wright as the perpetrator, but to act as a sophisticated red herring, 
designed to sow chaos, misdirection, and endless debate, thereby camouflaging 
the true identity and methods of the attacker. 

●  Supporting Evidence: On-chain analyst @Cyphertux noted the bizarre 
coincidence that a PDF document related to Craig Wright was reportedly 
modified on the same day as the event.26 Furthermore, Wright has a 
well-documented history of using legal threats and making claims about 
"Solomon's" keys, which stylistically mirrors the event's tactics.29 A sophisticated 
actor would know that any link, however tenuous, to Wright would instantly trigger 
a massive and distracting storm of debate, ridicule, and media attention, 
providing perfect cover for their operation. 

●  Counter-Argument: Craig Wright has repeatedly failed in court and in public to 
provide any cryptographic proof that he is Satoshi Nakamoto or that he controls 
any of Satoshi's wallets.3 His credibility within the technical community is 
effectively zero. Therefore, the idea that he himself could execute an exploit of 
this sophistication is widely dismissed. 

●  Sentiment: The theory that Craig Wright was literally behind the event is 

considered a fringe theory with very low credibility. However, the more nuanced 
interpretation—that the event was designed to look like something he would do as 
a deliberate misdirection—is seen as highly plausible by sophisticated analysts 
who appreciate the value of narrative warfare.26 

2.5 Hypothesis E: The "State-Level Actor" 

●  Core Argument: This hypothesis posits that a government agency, such as the 
U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), 
was behind the operation. The motive could be twofold: either to seize digital 
assets that are deemed abandoned or illicitly obtained, or to "tag" these 

 
 
 
 
high-value, anonymous coins to track their future movement through the global 
financial system for intelligence and law enforcement purposes. 

●  Supporting Evidence: Government agencies are known to be actively tracking 

cryptocurrency transactions and employ blockchain analysis firms like Chainalysis 
to do so.32 The highly organized, well-resourced, and methodical nature of the 
operation is consistent with the capabilities of a state actor. The legalistic 
language of the 
OP_RETURN notices and the salomonbros.com website, which attempts to 
establish a claim on "abandoned" property, closely mimics the legal processes of 
civil forfeiture or seizure.1 The most compelling piece of circumstantial evidence is 
the link to EisnerAmper, a real-world forensic accounting firm with a history of 
involvement in major federal cases.13 

●  Sentiment: This is a speculative but persistent theory, particularly popular among 
those with a cypherpunk or anti-government worldview. While difficult to prove 
without a direct admission, it fits the profile of the operation's sophistication and 
its blending of technical and legal tactics. 

The most credible of these hypotheses—the Heist, the White Hat, and the State 
Actor—all converge on a single, vital prerequisite: a successful cryptographic exploit. 
The variations are about the motive and identity of the actor, not the fundamental 
method. This establishes that the core of the investigation must be the technical 
vulnerability that allowed the private keys to be compromised in the first place. The 
rest, from the legal threats to the cryptic numbers, is theater built around this central 
technical achievement. This event also pioneers a new form of hybrid attack that 
could be termed "Legal-Ware": the use of legal concepts and threats as an active 
component of a digital asset exploit, designed to paralyze the victim with uncertainty 
while the technical attack secures the assets. 

Section III: The Ghost in the Machine — A Technical Deep Dive 
into the Exploit 

To understand how 80,000 BTC could be moved from wallets untouched for 14 years, 
it is essential to analyze the technical underpinnings of the most credible hypothesis: 
a cryptographic exploit targeting weaknesses in early Bitcoin wallets. This section 
provides a detailed analysis of the vulnerabilities in legacy address formats and the 
sophisticated attack methods used to compromise them, presented in a manner 

 
 
accessible to a non-cryptographic expert. The core of the issue is not a flaw in the 
Bitcoin protocol itself, but rather in the historical implementation of the software used 
to generate the keys. 

3.1 Bitcoin's Cryptographic Lineage: P2PKH's Faded Glory 

The wallets targeted in the July 4th event were all of the Pay-to-PubKey-Hash 
(P2PKH) type, the original and oldest address format in Bitcoin.7 Understanding the 
differences between this legacy format and modern standards is crucial to grasping 
why these specific wallets were vulnerable. 

●  P2PKH (Legacy): These addresses, which start with the number '1', were the 
standard in Bitcoin's early years (2009-2013).9 In a P2PKH scheme, the public 
address is a hash of the owner's public key. The full public key itself is not 
revealed on the blockchain until the 
first time funds are spent from that address.35 While this provides a layer of 
protection against attacks that require the full public key (like quantum attacks), 
the primary vulnerability of these addresses lies in how their corresponding 
private keys were generated. Early wallet software and websites from that era 
often used flawed or weak Random Number Generators (RNGs), which could lead 
to predictable or biased private keys.2 P2PKH addresses are also less efficient, 
resulting in higher transaction fees compared to modern formats.9 

●  SegWit (P2WPKH): Introduced in 2017, Segregated Witness (SegWit) was a major 
network upgrade designed to improve scalability and fix transaction malleability. 
Native SegWit addresses (P2WPKH) begin with 'bc1q'.9 By separating the digital 
signature data (the "witness") from the core transaction data, SegWit allows more 
transactions to fit into a block, thus lowering fees.10 From a security perspective, 
SegWit wallets are generated by modern software with more robust standards for 
randomness, and the address format itself includes better error-correcting codes 
to prevent typos.9 

●  Taproot (P2TR): The most recent major upgrade, activated in 2021, introduced 

Taproot addresses, which begin with 'bc1p'.9 Taproot brings significant 
enhancements to privacy and smart contract capabilities, primarily through the 
implementation of Schnorr signatures. Schnorr signatures allow for signature 
aggregation, which makes complex multi-signature transactions (common for 
high-security institutional custody) appear indistinguishable from simple, 
single-signature transactions on the blockchain.38 From a security standpoint, 

 
 
Taproot is a major leap forward. It can be structured to 
never reveal the full public key on-chain, even after funds are spent, offering a 
powerful theoretical defense against a future class of quantum computing attacks 
that could derive a private key from its corresponding public key.11 

Table 2: Comparative Analysis of Bitcoin Address Formats 

This table visually articulates the evolution of Bitcoin addresses and highlights why the 
2010-2011 P2PKH wallets were a specific and viable target for the July 4th exploit. It 
frames the event not as a failure of "Bitcoin" as a whole, but as the exploitation of a 
specific, legacy component of the system.

3.2 The Achilles' Heel of ECDSA: The Nonce 

 
 
 
 
The cryptographic exploit at the heart of the July 4th Anomaly targets a subtle but 
critical component of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), the 
system Bitcoin uses to verify transactions.41

requires the signer's private key, the hash of the message being signed, and a 
secret, single-use random number known as a "nonce," denoted by the variable 
k.40 The security of the entire system hinges on this nonce being unpredictable 
and unique for every single signature created with the same private key. 

●  Nonce Reuse Catastrophe: If the exact same nonce k is ever used to sign two 

different messages with the same private key, the private key is no longer secret. 
It can be trivially recovered using simple algebra from the two public signatures.40 
This is not a theoretical flaw; it is a well-known implementation bug that was 
responsible for the infamous 2010 Sony PlayStation 3 hack, where Sony used a 
static, non-random nonce, allowing hackers to calculate the console's master 
signing key.40 

●  Biased Nonce Vulnerability: The July 4th event likely did not involve such a 
blatant reuse of the exact same nonce. The attack was more sophisticated, 
exploiting a more subtle but equally devastating flaw: biased nonces. If the 
Random Number Generator (RNG) used by the wallet software to create the 
nonce k is flawed, the nonces it produces are not truly random. They may exhibit 
predictable patterns. For example, they might be consistently shorter than the 
required 256 bits, or a certain number of their leading bits might always be zero.26 
This was precisely the vulnerability that led to the theft of funds from some 
Android Bitcoin wallets in 2013, which used a flawed implementation of Java's 
SecureRandom class.40 The wallets targeted on July 4th, created in the 2010-2011 
era, are from a period notorious for such weak RNG implementations in early 
Bitcoin software.7 

3.3 The Art of the Lattice Attack: Breaking Biased Signatures 

When a private key has been used to create multiple signatures with biased nonces, it 
becomes vulnerable to a powerful cryptanalytic technique known as a lattice attack.47 

●  The Concept: A lattice attack can recover a secret private key by analyzing a 

collection of public signatures that were all created using nonces from a weak or 

 
 
 
biased RNG. It does not require knowing the nonces, only that they share a 
predictable flaw. 

●  The Mechanics (Simplified): 

1.  The Hidden Number Problem (HNP): The core mathematical challenge is 
known as the Hidden Number Problem. Each biased signature provides a 
small, imperfect "clue" about the secret private key. The HNP is the problem 
of finding the full secret number (the private key) when all you have is a large 
collection of these fuzzy clues.42 The ECDSA signature equation, 
s=k−1(h+dr)(modn), can be rearranged to k≡s−1h+(s−1r)d(modn). If the nonce 
k is biased (e.g., small), this equation provides a linear congruence that gives 
a hint about the private key d. 

2.  Lattices as a Geometric Tool: The attacker takes these mathematical clues 

(the linear congruences from each signature) and represents them as a set of 
vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors define the points of a 
geometric grid-like structure called a lattice.52 

3.  Finding the Shortest Vector: The solution to the system of equations—which 
reveals the private key—corresponds to a uniquely "short" vector (or a path 
between two points) within this highly complex lattice. The problem of finding 
the private key is thus transformed into a geometric problem of finding the 
shortest path in the lattice. 

4.  Lattice Reduction Algorithms (LLL/BKZ): While finding the absolute 

shortest vector in a lattice is computationally hard, powerful algorithms like 
LLL (Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovász) and BKZ (Block Korkine-Zolotarev) can 
efficiently find a very short vector that is often the correct solution.43 By 
feeding the public signature data into these algorithms, an attacker can solve 
the HNP and recover the private key. The attack's success rate increases with 
the number of signatures collected and the degree of bias in the nonces.42 

3.4 Case Study: The "JohnnyTX" / Puzzle #130 Precedent (July-September 2024) 

The feasibility of such an attack is not merely theoretical. The events of 
July-September 2024 provided a stunning public demonstration of the resources and 
techniques required. 

●  The Puzzles: The Bitcoin "Transaction Puzzles," created by a user named 

"JohnnyTX" and others, are a long-standing challenge in the community. They 
consist of Bitcoin addresses funded with real BTC, but with private keys that are 

 
 
intentionally weakened. For example, a key might be a 256-bit number where the 
first 190 bits are all zero, leaving only 66 bits of "entropy" to be discovered.55 
●  The 2024 Breakthroughs: In the summer of 2024, the community witnessed the 
solving of several high-difficulty puzzles that had been outstanding for years. 
Notably, Puzzle #66 (with 66 bits of entropy) was solved, and even more 
significantly, Puzzle #130 was cracked.55 Puzzle #130 was a special case where 
the public key was known, reducing the effective work to break the 130-bit key to 
roughly 
265 operations using algorithms like Pollard's rho.55 

●  Significance as a Precursor: The solving of these puzzles was a critical technical 
precursor to the July 4th Anomaly. It served as a public, real-world benchmark, 
proving that the computational power (via massive, distributed GPU clusters) and 
the mathematical algorithms needed to break keys with a known degree of 
weakness were now practically accessible to well-resourced, non-state actors. 
For a sophisticated attacker planning the 80k BTC heist, the fall of Puzzle #130 
was the "canary in the coal mine"—a clear signal that their planned attack against 
real-world wallets with similar (or greater) weaknesses from the weak RNG era 
was now computationally feasible. 

The convergence of these factors—the existence of a pool of legacy P2PKH wallets 
created with flawed software, the public nature of the blockchain allowing for the 
collection of signatures over many years, and the recent democratization of the 
computational power and algorithms needed to execute a lattice attack—created the 
perfect storm for the July 4th Anomaly. 

Section IV: The Aftershock — Systemic Risks and the Future of 
Bitcoin 

The July 4th Anomaly transcends a mere transfer of funds; it is a seismic event that 
exposes fundamental challenges and systemic risks within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Its 
aftershocks will reverberate for years, impacting the network's technical evolution, its 
economic narratives, its legal standing, and its appeal to institutional investors. The 
event forces a confrontation with difficult questions about Bitcoin's ability to adapt, 
the certainty of its supply, the nature of digital ownership, and the fragility of its 
market narrative. 

 
 
4.1 Cryptographic Agility: Bitcoin's Inability to Evolve 

The exploit of legacy P2PKH wallets serves as a stark and practical illustration of 
"cryptographic obsolescence"—the inevitable process by which cryptographic 
algorithms are weakened over time by advances in computing and cryptanalysis.59 The 
July 4th event is a live-fire drill for the much larger, long-anticipated threat of 
quantum computing, which is expected to one day break the ECDSA algorithm 
entirely.24 

This highlights a core structural challenge for Bitcoin: its lack of cryptographic agility. 
Crypto-agility is the ability of a system to seamlessly transition to new, stronger 
cryptographic algorithms without disruptive changes to its infrastructure.60 For a 
centralized service, such an upgrade can be mandated from the top down. For a 
decentralized network like Bitcoin, it is a monumental undertaking that requires broad, 
voluntary consensus among thousands of independent miners, developers, and users 
to implement a network-wide soft or hard fork. 

The slow adoption of past upgrades like SegWit and Taproot demonstrates this 
inertia. While Taproot offers superior security and privacy, a significant portion of the 
network continues to use older, less secure address formats.39 The July 4th Anomaly 
proves that this is not a theoretical risk. The inability to easily and swiftly migrate the 
entire network to state-of-the-art cryptographic standards represents a profound 
systemic vulnerability. The network's strength—its decentralized and 
consensus-driven nature—becomes a weakness when rapid evolution is required to 
counter an emerging threat. 

4.2 Supply Uncertainty: The Myth of the Lost Coins 

A cornerstone of Bitcoin's economic narrative and valuation models is its absolute, 
predictable scarcity, capped at 21 million coins. Embedded within this narrative is the 
widespread assumption that a significant portion of the "ancient supply"—coins that 
have not moved in over a decade—is permanently lost and thus removed from 
circulation.62 As of June 2025, this ancient supply accounted for over 17% of all issued 

 
 
 
 
Bitcoin, or nearly 3.4 million BTC.63 

The July 4th Anomaly shatters this comforting myth. The sudden re-entry of 80,000 
coins, previously presumed dormant or lost, into the active supply constitutes a 
significant supply shock.5 It forces a radical re-evaluation of a critical question: how 
much Bitcoin is truly lost, and how much is merely dormant and potentially 
recoverable by a sophisticated actor? 

If the cryptographic weaknesses that enabled this event are present in other large, 
dormant wallets from the same era—including, hypothetically, the million-coin stash 
attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto—the effective circulating supply of Bitcoin could be 
substantially larger than current models assume. This introduces a new, 
unquantifiable variable into Bitcoin's supply dynamics. The potential for other "ghost" 
wallets to reawaken could create long-term downward pressure on price, challenging 
the core "digital scarcity" narrative that underpins much of its value proposition and 
institutional appeal.62 

4.3 Legal & Ownership Void: "Code is Law" vs. Property Law 

The actor's methodical use of the salomonbros.com website and the legalistic 
OP_RETURN messages was not merely theater; it was a calculated legal gambit 
designed to force a confrontation between two fundamentally different concepts of 
ownership. 

●  The "Code is Law" Ethos: Within the native crypto ecosystem, the prevailing 
ethos is that "code is law." Possession of the private key is absolute proof of 
ownership, granting the holder the sole and irrevocable right to control the 
associated assets.15 In this world, the actor who successfully compromised the 
keys is the new, legitimate owner. 

●  Traditional Property Law: In the traditional legal world, ownership is a bundle of 
rights granted and protected by the state. Concepts like "abandoned property" 
and "adverse possession" provide legal frameworks through which ownership can 
be transferred even without the original owner's consent, provided certain 
conditions are met.66 

The July 4th Anomaly deliberately crashes these two worlds into each other. The actor 
created a public, immutable record of their "claim" on what they framed as 
"abandoned" property, and they provided a "remedy" period for the original owner to 

 
 
come forward.1 This raises a novel and deeply disruptive legal question: If an asset has 
been digitally "abandoned" on-chain for 14 years, can a third party use a 
cryptographic exploit to take control of it and then seek protection and legitimacy 
under the framework of traditional property law? This event opens a Pandora's box of 
legal ambiguity, creating a void that courts and regulators will be forced to address. 

4.4 Narrative Fragility: A Blow to Institutional Confidence 

For the nascent institutional adoption of Bitcoin, the July 4th Anomaly is a devastating 
blow. The nuanced technical reality—that a specific, legacy component was 
exploited—is often lost in the broader market. The headline risk of "80,000 BTC 
Stolen" or "Bitcoin Hacked" is profoundly damaging to market confidence.68 

Institutional investors, such as pension funds, endowments, and large corporations, 
require predictability, robust security, and clear legal recourse before deploying 
capital at scale.68 This single event undermines all three pillars of institutional 
confidence: 

●  Security: It introduces a new, highly technical, and difficult-to-understand 

security risk (lattice attacks on legacy wallets) that was previously considered 
largely theoretical. 

●  Predictability: It creates fundamental uncertainty about the true circulating 

supply of Bitcoin, disrupting the scarcity models upon which institutional theses 
are built. 

●  Legal Recourse: It highlights a legal and ownership void, demonstrating that 
even a multi-billion dollar fortune can be compromised with unclear paths to 
recovery or justice. 

This could cause risk-averse institutions to pause, reverse, or delay their adoption of 
Bitcoin, fearing not only direct financial loss but also significant reputational damage 
and regulatory scrutiny.69 The fact that major investment products like spot Bitcoin 
ETFs rely on single custodians like Coinbase further concentrates this risk, creating a 
potential single point of failure that is antithetical to Bitcoin's decentralized ethos.70 

The aftermath of this event will serve as a critical test of Bitcoin's decentralized 
governance. There will inevitably be calls for radical, centralized solutions, such as a 
hard fork to reverse the transactions—a move that would violate the core principle of 
immutability. Conversely, a "do nothing" approach would uphold the "code is law" 

 
 
ethos but would effectively ratify an $8.6 billion theft. The ensuing debate will reveal 
the true political and philosophical fault lines within the Bitcoin community and set a 
powerful precedent for how the network confronts future existential threats. 

Conclusion: A Paradigm Shift in Digital Risk 

The July 4th Anomaly, irrespective of the actor's ultimate identity or motive, 
represents a fundamental and irreversible turning point for Bitcoin and the broader 
digital asset space. It marks the moment when a long-theorized class of sophisticated 
cryptographic attacks transitioned from the academic to the practical, executed at a 
scale previously unimaginable. The event was not a simple hack but a masterfully 
orchestrated operation, blending high-level cryptanalysis with legal maneuvering and 
psychological warfare. 

This report's analysis leads to several key conclusions. First, the weight of the 
on-chain evidence overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis of a hostile takeover via a 
cryptographic exploit, rendering the "panicked owner" narrative untenable. The 
methodical precision, the cross-chain "canary" test, and the elaborate narrative 
construction are the hallmarks of a professional adversary. 

Second, the event shatters the comforting illusion of "lost coins," which has long been 
a quiet pillar of Bitcoin's scarcity narrative. The sudden reanimation of 80,000 BTC 
forces a market-wide repricing of risk associated with the vast trove of dormant, 
legacy-era wallets. This introduces a new and significant element of supply 
uncertainty that could have lasting economic consequences. 

Third, the incident exposes the critical challenge of "cryptographic agility" for 
decentralized networks. Bitcoin's resistance to change, a feature that provides 
stability, becomes a liability when its underlying cryptography is threatened by 
obsolescence. The July 4th Anomaly is a stark warning that the network must find 
ways to evolve more rapidly to counter future threats, most notably the advent of 
quantum computing. 

Finally, the event ignites a crucial and unavoidable conflict between the nascent, 
code-based laws of the blockchain and the established property laws of the 
traditional world. The actor's legal gambit forces a societal and judicial reckoning with 

 
 
the question of what constitutes ownership and abandonment in the digital realm. 

The July 4th Anomaly is, in essence, a forced maturation of the ecosystem. It 
demands a more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of risk, where not all 
bitcoins are considered equal. It will likely catalyze the creation of a new risk 
classification—"Cryptographically Vulnerable Property"—and accelerate the migration 
away from legacy systems. While profoundly disruptive, the attack may inadvertently 
serve as the most powerful catalyst for a network-wide security upgrade in Bitcoin's 
history. It is a painful but necessary lesson, demonstrating that in a world built on pure 
mathematics, the elegance of an algorithm can be as powerful as any army, capable 
of summoning or seizing fortunes and reshaping the future of finance.
